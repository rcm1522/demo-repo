My name is Rayven McMillian, and I am a senior who is majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Mathematics at Mississippi State University. With my major, I plan to go into the high voltage and power field, mainly Power Distribution. Also, fun fact about me is that I have a Minitature Dachshund and a Great Dane.
